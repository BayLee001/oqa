# System Predictions
This directory contains the predictions made by each system during evaluation.
Each file is a collection of predictions in the form `(question, prediction, 
score, trace)` where `question` is the input question, `prediction` is the 
predicted answer, `score` is the system's score assigned to that answer, and
`trace` is a string description of the derivation from question to predicted
answer. There is one tab-separated prediction per line.
